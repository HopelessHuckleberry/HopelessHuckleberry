### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an older guy trying to learn **web development** while working in a 3-shift job in a factory. On my free time I also like working out at the gym, walking and playing guitar.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **HTML, CSS** and **Javascript**. After I start feeling comfortable with Javascript I'm planning on learning either **React.JS** or **Vue.Js** next...
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a **responsive website**. Pretty basic one, but this will be my first using a mobile first approach. Because of my busy daily schedule this will be a bit slow, but I'm looking forward to getting practice with building layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox on top of all the other stuff.
